# Global Sales Performance Analysis for Strategic Decision-Making

## Company Background
A multinational corporation, **"GlobalTech Solutions,"** operates in diverse markets worldwide, focusing on consumer electronics and technology services. The company has a vast network of suppliers and distribution channels across key regions such as the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The company’s executive team is highly focused on maximizing revenue, minimizing costs, and optimizing net profits across different geographical regions and product categories.

## Business Challenge
GlobalTech Solutions is preparing for a critical board meeting where the company's leadership will review the performance of various regions and make strategic decisions on future investments, resource allocation, and market focus. The key areas of concern include understanding which countries generate the highest gross revenue, assessing the financial performance of the two key Asian markets (China and Japan), analyzing order distribution by geographical area, evaluating revenue proportions by country, and determining the net revenue contribution from key suppliers in the United Kingdom.

## Dashboard Overview
The **"Sales Executive Dashboard"** has been designed to provide a comprehensive overview of GlobalTech Solutions' financial and operational performance across different regions. The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

1. **Average Gross Revenue by Country:**
   - This bar chart highlights the gross revenue generated by each country. Italy leads with the highest average gross revenue, followed by Jamaica and Trinidad. This data is critical for identifying the most lucrative markets and guiding investment decisions.

2. **Financial Averages for China and Japan:**
   - A comparative analysis of average cost, net revenue, and gross revenue for China and Japan. This visualization is essential for evaluating the profitability of these key markets and informing strategies to improve margins in Asia.

3. **Number of Orders by Geographical Area:**
   - A donut chart representing the distribution of orders across the Americas, Asia, and Europe. This helps the company understand where the majority of orders are being placed, which can influence marketing and distribution strategies.

4. **Proportion of Gross Revenue by Country:**
   - A pie chart showing the percentage contribution of gross revenue from each country. The USA and Jamaica are leading contributors, indicating strong market presence and potential areas for further growth.

5. **Total Net Revenue by Supplier in the UK:**
   - A bar chart displaying the net revenue generated by two key suppliers in the UK. This data is crucial for supply chain optimization and renegotiating supplier contracts to enhance profitability.

## Strategic Insights and Recommendations

- **Market Expansion:**
  - Given Italy’s high gross revenue, there is an opportunity to expand product lines or increase marketing efforts in this region to further capitalize on its strong performance.

- **Cost Management in Asia:**
  - The financial analysis of China and Japan shows significant differences in net revenue, with China having a higher net revenue than Japan despite higher costs. Strategic initiatives should be aimed at cost reduction in Japan to improve profitability, possibly by leveraging economies of scale or optimizing supply chains.

- **Resource Allocation:**
  - With the Americas generating the highest number of orders, it may be beneficial to allocate more resources to this region to maintain momentum and address any emerging challenges that could impact order fulfillment and customer satisfaction.

- **Supplier Negotiations:**
  - The net revenue analysis from UK suppliers highlights a performance gap. It may be prudent to negotiate better terms with lower-performing suppliers or consider alternative suppliers to boost net revenue.

- **Revenue Diversification:**
  - The varied proportions of gross revenue across different countries suggest that GlobalTech Solutions should consider diversifying its revenue streams by increasing market share in underperforming regions like India and France.

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides actionable insights that GlobalTech Solutions can leverage to drive growth, enhance profitability, and make informed strategic decisions. The visualizations not only offer a snapshot of the current performance but also point towards potential areas for improvement and expansion, making this an essential tool for the executive team.
